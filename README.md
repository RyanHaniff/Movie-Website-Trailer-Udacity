# Movie Website Trailer

Movie Website Trailer displays six of my favourite movies created in python. It displays the name, a poster image and if you click on the image it plays the trailer of said image. A helper module called fresh_tomatoes is used to convert it to a html file.

## Requirements

Python must be installed on your computer.
If you do not have it installed you can install it [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14-macosx10.6.pkg).

## Installation

Click the green Clone or downlaodd button and choose **Download ZIP** then extract the zip as a whole file.

## How to Run Program

To run the program with Command Prompt or Terminal:
1) Locate where you downloaded the repository
2) Go to the directory where you unzipped the file
4) Open the subfolder until you can see the python script files
3) To then execute type in the command: `python entertainment_center.py`

A browser window will open up with the movies being displayed.

The fresh_tomatoes file was used to convert the python code into html so that it can be viewed on a browser. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode).
